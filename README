Thank you for choosing AZURE2 to for all your R-Matrix needs.

This file contains a brief description of how to compile the AZURE2 package.  


Dependencies:

AZURE2 is compiled using the CMake package.  Version 2.8 or higher of CMake is (probably) required to build AZURE2.  CMake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org. Additionally, much of the mathematics in AZURE2 uses the GSL routines.  This library can be obtained from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/.  The minimization routines utilized by AZURE are from the Minuit2 package, distributed as part of the ROOT distribution.  If ROOT is compiled from source, the --enable-minuit2 flag must be set when running the configure script.  The libraries are available as a stand-alone package from http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/snapshot/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html.  It is important to note that the ROOT library DOES NOT build Minuit2 with OpenMP support by default, while the stand-alone version does.  On a multi-core machine the fit process will be much slower without OpenMP.  To build ROOT with OpenMP support for Minuit2, set the enviromnet variables USE_PARALLEL_MINUIT2 and USE_OPENMP prior to building.  The final compile time dependency is Qt.  Qt is a cross-platform interface API, and required to compile the graphical setup program.  While AZURE2 can be compiled without the graphical setup program, this is not recommended. Qt is available from http://qt.nokia.com. Qt 4.4 or greater is required to build AZURE2.


The following steps should be performed to build the AZURE2 package:

1.  Create a subdirectory of the AZURE2 root named build [mkdir build], and change to that directory [cd build].

2.  Run CMake to generate Makefiles from AZURE2 root [cmake ..].  The reference to the parent directory tells CMake where the root of the source tree is located.  

3.  Build the package [make && make install].  The resulting binary will be created in the current directory.


Options:

Compiling options (i.e. switching compilers, etc.) are available with flags to CMake.  See the CMake documentation for more details.

A few options are available to the user when building AZURE2.  The can be passed to cmake using the -D[OPTION]=[VALUE] syntax.  CMake also provides a utility to switch these options ON/OFF.   After an initial configuration of the build directory (step 2 above), the command [ccmake ..] can be run to view and edit the configured options. 

These are:

BUILD_GUI [ON/OFF] - Toggles whether the graphical setup utility is built and linked to AZURE2.  This is ON by default, and it is not recommended to turn it OFF.

USE_EXT_COUL [ON/OFF] - Toggles whether the non-GSL Coulomb functions of N. Michel should be used.  The default is OFF.  See note below for more details.

USE_STAT [ON/OFF] - Toggles whether the stat() function should be used to test for properly set directories at start.  This only applied when running AZURE2 in console (--no-gui) mode, and is ON by default.  This function has been seen to not work properly for Windows, and it is recommended to select OFF if building on/for a Windows system.

MINUIT_PATH [dir] - If Minuit2 is in a non-standard path, this will add the directory to the search path.

GSL_PATH [dir] - If GSL is in a non-standard path, this will add the directory to the search path.

After changing options, execute [make clean] and then step 3 above to build/rebuild AZURE2.  


A note about the Coulomb Functions:

The AZURE2 package uses, by default, the GSL Coulomb Functions in its calculations.  For certain regions in the rho-eta plane, these functions invoke a WKB approximation which is not very accurate.  This most often manifests itself as discontinuous jump in the calculated excitation curve.  The main advantage of these functions is that they are extremely fast.

A second Coulomb function option is available in AZURE2.  These functions are from N. Michel, Computer Physics Communications 176, 232 (2007).  The files have only been modified to be compilable as a library, and to remove the dependency on a global std namespace.  The routines are otherwise unchanged.  These functions are extremely accurate, but significantly slower. 

IMPORTANT:  When switching between Coulomb function versions, 'make clean' should first be called.
